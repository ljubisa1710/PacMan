Introduction

This repository contains the source code for our version of the classic Pac-Man game. 
My goal is to recreate the original game as closely as possible while adding some modern enhancements.

Current Features

    My game currently has three of the original four ghosts implemented, namely Blinky, Pinky, and Inky.
    Each ghost has its unique behavior implemented as per the original game.
    Advanced pathfinding for the ghosts, allowing them to navigate the maze effectively.

Upcoming Features

    Clyde, the fourth ghost from the original game, is the next feature planned to be added.
    Gameplay aspects such as pellets, power-ups, and lives will be implemented subsequently.
    High score tracking and UI improvements are also planned for future updates.
