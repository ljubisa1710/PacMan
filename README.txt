Overview

This repository contains a Pac-Man game intricately developed using JavaScript and brought to life through the p5.js library, primarily for game visualization and rendering. Integrated within an HTML framework, the game is accessible via web browsers, offering a seamless gaming experience. p5.js simplifies graphics and interactivity in JavaScript, enabling the reimagining of a classic game like Pac-Man for modern web audiences. The gameplay taps into the traditional A* pathfinding algorithm for the ghosts' movement, treating players to a genuine Pac-Man ambiance.

Features

    Web Integration with HTML

    The game is encapsulated within a robust HTML structure, making it readily playable on web browsers. The HTML framework not only hosts the game canvas provided by p5.js but also ensures compatibility across different devices, creating a versatile gaming platform.

    p5.js and JavaScript Synergy

    Central to the game's build is the p5.js library—a JavaScript library tailored for graphics and interactive applications. With p5.js, the game boasts smooth animations, quick-reacting controls, and a visually rich portrayal of the classic Pac-Man maze.

    2D Grid Environment

    The game arena is conceptualized as a 2D grid. Leveraging p5.js, each grid cell is rendered with precision, representing open spaces, walls, or game entities like Pac-Man or ghosts. Staying true to the original, walls are patterned as per the classic game layout, and the game entities' positioning is dynamically updated every frame, mirroring the live game state.

    A Path-finding Algorithm in Action*

    The ghosts, keen on their pursuit, utilize the A* path-finding algorithm. Backed by the nimbleness of JavaScript, their paths are recalculated at every strategic point—be it junctions or after designated frame intervals—making ghost movement both dynamic and adaptive.

    Intuitive Manual Controls

    Thanks to the interactive capabilities of p5.js, coupled with the structured HTML canvas, players can manually control Pac-Man using keyboard inputs. This setup provides real-time game response, ensuring an engaging and fluid Pac-Man adventure.
